This is worth testing for because the search bar could be hard to find for the user and it might not be clear that you are able to click on the topic to see the responses.

I want to see if it’s clear that the "Update Side" button is for this purpose and not lost among other buttons. Also, since "Side" isn’t a common term in social media, it may create confusion. Lastly, I’m interested in seeing if users can create responses smoothly, especially since adding labels works differently than the usual method.</td>

## Study Reports
### User 1
<!-- - making a new user
    - too easy
- search topics -> find the topic "Android vs. iPhone"
    - no issues
- respond, side, add label to response
    - doesn't see a place to put their side, found out they can click it
    - tried to click on the opinion spectrum expecting it to be choosing a side
        - found out that it wasn't the correct move because she noticed that it said "No responses.", so she assumed that that wasn't the correct way to put your side
    - confused about the thing on the spectrum with a slightly different color, but it's a similar color to hovering over the other options on the spectrum
    - confused about why it says "Update Side" when they haven't picked a side yet
    - side page:
        - there are two buttons to choose from for submitting
        - confused the difference between undecided and neutral
    - when adding a label, confused because when she clicked on the thing on the dropdown, it added right away instead of clicking the add button
        - still works tho
- sort and filter by label for topics
    - typed food into the search instead of using the filtering
- sort and filter by degree for responses
    - doesn't know what i mean by controversial
    - tried to filter by controversial
    - found that she could sort by controversial
        - found it weird to quantify controversialness
- respond to response, upvote, user page
    - was going to use the search function to find the user page
    - ultimately mistakenly found that you could click on the username
- create topic, add label to topic, delete
    - 
- non-biased samples??
    - was very confused, tried to filter, couldn't find
    - big barrier was the wording
        - helped her get there
    - knew how to shuffle tho

- didn't understand what the labels were on the topic page
- too many colors? labels don't need to be colored
- confused because there is filtering for the sides but also a separate filtering button?
- confused with the word "response" makes more sense to post in the topic
- need to add dropdown or something with adding a label to topic (or even add like text about an example: food, politics, serious, etc.) bc it's confusing what they're for (filtering) -->

Interviewee 1 moved easily through basic actions, like creating a new user profile and searching for the topic “Android vs. iPhone,” showing that onboarding and basic search are intuitive. However, more unique features, like choosing sides, were harder to understand. For example, when attempting to respond with her side, she struggled to figure out where to input her stance. She initially assumed that clicking the opinion spectrum would set her side, showing a disconnect between expected and actual interactions with this feature. After doing this, she looked to me to move on to the next task but appeared confused when she saw the message “No responses found.” This moment highlighted that clicking the opinion spectrum didn’t clearly indicate it wasn’t how to set a side. When she reached the side-input page, she paused at the “Decided!” and “Undecided” buttons, saying she’d expected “Undecided” to be one of the spectrum options, with only one button to submit her side.

The response labels feature also revealed unexpected challenges. When adding a label, she initially expected to click “Add” to confirm her choice, so she looked surprised when the label was added immediately. Though it functioned as intended, her reaction suggested the label-selection process wasn’t very intuitive.

On a positive note, interactions with response-related features like replying and upvoting were smooth. She recognized the arrow icons for voting and quickly clicked “Reply” to respond to other posts, showing these icons aligned well with her expectations. However, the “Non-Biased Samples” feature proved challenging. She struggled to locate these samples due to linguistic and conceptual barriers, which was like due to this feature being so unique to the app. She didn't understand why there was a shuffle button and didn't understand the point of seeing random responses because there was no way to save them and refer back to them later. Futhermore, she questioned whether randomization was necessary, because it was jarring for her to go from one response to the next that didn't have any relation to one another. This suggests that the user experience could be smoother with this feature.

Lastly, she used the label filter feature without difficulty and noted that the labels looked familiar and were easy to recognize. However, she found the different label colors on the topic page distracting and was unsure if they were the same as those on responses.

These insights point to a need for clearer terminology, intuitive label guidance, and better differentiation between interactive elements, which would make navigation smoother and features easier to interpret.


### User 2

<!-- - making a new user
    - easy
- search topics
    - easy
- respond, side, add label to response
    - clicked on the opinion spectrum and then clicked update side (not correct), eventually figured out update side, everything else fine
- sort and filter by label for topics
    - search labels (not filters), was confused about whether controversial is in filters or sort (filter was first instinct), 
- sort and filter by label for topics
    - first instinct was to search for "food" instead of filtering for it, should have more clear terminology
- sort and filter by degree for responses
    - fine
    - wasn't sure what the default for sorting is, no clear button?, should be clear
- respond to response, upvote, user page
    - forgot what she was responding to, so it was hard to write a response
- create topic, add label to topic, delete
    - wasn't sure if she was making a new label or not since there was no drop down
    - clicked add button with nothing because she thought it would make a dropdown appear
- non-biased samples??
    - didn't like that it was at the top
    - she's not looking at it
    - looked through the sort, filter, and search

- the at sign on usernames helps with finding the user page
- for filters, add a clear all button for ease -->

Interviewee 2 completed the initial user setup and topic search smoothly, confirming that basic onboarding and search functions remain straightforward. However, when adding responses and choosing a side, similar to the first interviewee, she encountered some confusion. She clicked the opinion spectrum, assuming that she was selecting her new side, and then clicked “Update Side” to actually submit her inputted side to the app. She was very surprised when this button took her to a new page, showing that the side-selection process still isn’t fully intuitive. She eventually found the correct steps, though her initial approach reflects a misalignment between user assumptions and the interface.

Sorting and filtering also had mixed results. When asked to sort and filter by label, Interviewee 2 first looked at the search bar and searched the label "food" instead of filtering, which shows that “Filter” may not be the most effective label for this task. She also looked unsure about whether the “Controversial” sorting option would appear in filters or sorting. While she sorted responses without issue, she was unsure about the default sorting option, noting that there was no indication of it, which could be an area for clearer labeling.

Responding to responses, upvoting, and visiting user pages were mostly intuitive. She had no issues with finding the button to reply to other responses like Interviewee 1, demonstrating that the "Reply" button and icon easily communicates its function to the user. However, she briefly forgot what she was responding to, making it difficult to write a reply, which indicates that more context might help users track conversations. Creating a new topic also presented minor usability questions. She wasn’t sure if she was generating a new label or if one existed in a dropdown, so she clicked “Add” with no selection, expecting it to bring up a dropdown. These points suggest users may benefit from extra cues on adding or selecting labels.

For the “Non-Biased Samples” feature, she initially looked through sorting, filtering, and searching. Even though she eventually found it in the end, she told me that she wasn’t sure if the button to navigate to the samples should be placed at the top. This feedback indicates that the feature’s placement may not align with user expectations, and like the first interviewee, she had difficulty locating it.

She also mentioned that the “@” sign by usernames was helpful for finding user pages and suggested a “Clear All” button for filters to make the interface smoother. These findings underscore a need for clearer terminology and visual cues, especially around the “side” feature and label selection.

## Design Flaws/Opportunities

<!-- 1. Non-Biased Samples: critical, linguistic & conceptual
- Since Non-Biased Samples are a unique feature on my app, users had a hard time finding the page without looking through all the possible pages, demonstrating a linguistic problem. Furthermore, interviewee 1 had a couple conceptual issues like not being able to refer back to responses later and randomization leading to a jarring user experience. Both interviewees when asked replied that they would not have used this or found this feature if they hadn't been prompted by me. These issues mostly all stem from the fact that this is a unique feature that users aren't used to, which means that they need to be explained further and the users need to be guided more. Some of the ways to solve these issues is to rename the feature/page to be more indicative to the feature like "Non-Biased Responses", banners that advertise the feature to users, and adding 


- setting a side: major, linguistic
- seeing response when responding: minor, physical
- differentiating topic and response labels: moderate, linguistic -->

1. Non-Biased Samples
- Level: Linguistic & Conceptual
- Severity: Critical
- Flaw/Opportunity: The unique “Non-Biased Samples” feature was challenging to locate, as both interviewees initially looked through sorting, filtering, and search options to find it. Conceptually, Interviewee 2 was unsure about the purpose of randomizing responses without the ability to save or revisit specific samples. This disconnect indicates a need for clearer access points and more guidance and explanation of this unique feature.
- Cause: This issue likely stems from both linguistic barriers (the name "Non-Biased Samples" isn’t very descriptive and isn't a common feature in social media) and conceptual challenges (the randomized content with no ability to save and jarring user experience).
- Ways to Fix:
    - Rename the feature to something more descriptive, like “Unbiased Responses” or “Anonymous Responses”
    - Add a brief, descriptive tooltip or banner to introduce and promote the feature to users
    - Include a “Save” or “Bookmark” function for revisiting specific samples later

2. Setting a Side
- Level: Linguistic
- Severity: Major
- Flaw/Opportunity: Both users experienced difficulty when attempting to set their side on a topic, mistaking the opinion spectrum filter for a selection tool. Interviewee 2 initially clicked on the spectrum itself before proceeding to the “Update Side” button, which led to confusion and unexpected navigation. The “Decided!” and “Undecided” options also caused some hesitation, as Interviewee 2 felt confused by having both buttons act as a submit button to updating their side.
- Cause: The term “side” may be unfamiliar or feel unclear in this context, and the expectation that the opinion spectrum should set a side indicates a linguistic mismatch between what the app’s wording suggests and how the feature actually functions. Futhermore, with the buttons that confused Interviewee 2, this is probably because in most UIs there is just one submit button, so the app didn't follow the normal form submitting flow.
- Ways to Fix:
    - Rename “Update Side” to something clearer like “Set Position” or “Choose Stance” to clarify its function
    - Explicitly label the opinion spectrum as a filter tool for viewing responses rather than selecting a side
    - Create a short tutorial for first time users outlining how to choose a side and what the opinion spectrum is for
    - Condense “Decided!” and “Undecided” into one "submit" button

3. Seeing Response Users are Responding to
- Level: Physical
- Severity: Minor
- Flaw/Opportunity: Interviewee 2 briefly lost context while making a reply, as they had forgotten the content of the original response they were addressing. Without the prior response for reference, maintaining the conversation flow was difficult, suggesting that additional context during the reply process would support user interactions.
- Cause: Physically, users lost context while writing responses without a reference to the original content, because it's easy to forget what things in the original response users want to address in their current response.
- Ways to Fix:
    - Modify the interface to allow users to reply directly to a response within the topic page, removing the need to navigate to a separate page
    - Display the original comment being responded to above the reply input box, allowing users to easily review the context as they write.

4. Differentiating Topic and Response Labels
- Level: Linguistic
- Severity: Moderate
- Flaw/Opportunity: Interviewee 1 was confused by the visual differences between topic and response labels. The varying colors felt distracting, and without additional descriptors, interviewee 1 was unsure if the label types functioned differently. They also didn't understand why there were labels on the top left of the topic page.
- Cause: The current label design associates labels in general to both responses and topics without clear differentiation. Only having colors as the differentiator wasn't clear to the user and was only distracting. This causes a linguistic ambiguity in how these labels are interpreted.
- Ways to Fix:
    - Change the color scheme for labels to a neutral, consistent dark grey, which will reduce visual distraction
    - Add a small descriptor near each label set, such as “Topic Labels” vs. “Response Labels” to improve clarity.
