# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding
## Hunch
I believe that social media these days has become an echo chamber, which makes it harder to learn about opinions of people who have different views and perspectives.
## People
### Interviewee 1
- Age: 22 years old
- Republican
- One child (1 years old)
- Recently married
- From Texas
- Education: Didn’t go to college
- Job: construction worker

I chose this interviewee, because he is very different from me. Although he is similar in age, he is in a different stage of life being that he is married and has a child. He has a job and has to support his family, so his priorities in life are probably going to vary from me (I don't have to a support a family and am a full time student). He also didn't go to college, while I'm a college student. I would expect this to have a big affect on how he uses social media and the difference in how we both use social media. Lastly, I have a hunch that applies to many political issues, so I wanted to interview someone with a political perspective that's different from mine. I felt this was important to include in my interviews because I believe that political ideologies in America have become increasingly polarized.


### Interviewee 2
- Age: 14 years old
- Democrat
- From Texas
- Education: Freshman in High School
- Job: Student
- Tail of Gen Z

I chose this interviewee mainly because of their age. Especially because social media is becoming more prevalent, I wanted to gain the perspective of someone younger than me who's generation has more widspread use of social media. I believe this would affect their usage and opinons of social media greatly. Another reason why is because they have a differing political perspective from my first interviewee. I believe that the two sides of the political spectrum have very different opinons about social media, so I wanted to capture this in my interviews.

## Conversation Starters
- What are some hobbies you have?
- When you’re on your phone, what are you usually doing?
    - How does that make you feel?
- Do you or your friends post about political or controversial topics on social media? If so, do you mind sharing what kind of topics? If not, why do you choose not to?
    - How do these posts make you feel when you see them and/or post them?
    - How do you feel about the information shared in these posts?
- What kinds of people and/or organizations do you follow on social media?
    - In what ways, if any, do your interests align or differ from the people and/or organizations you follow?
- Do you follow trends when uploading to social media platforms like Tik Tok or Instagram? If so, what kinds of trends?
    - How do you feel about these trends?
- Where do you get your news/current events information from?
    - How do you feel about keeping up with current events? Can you share your perspective on why it might or might not be important?
- What kind of controversial topics are you interested in or have a strong opinion in?

## Interview Plan
I plan to write notes as the interview takes place and look up often to observe that kinds of expression my interviewee makes and what behaviors they exhibit when I ask my questions. To help with this, I also plan to record my interviews and add more to my notes later.

## Write Up for Interviewee 1
- **What are some hobbies you have?**
- He likes to fish, working out, build things with his hands, and recently got into hunting with his older brother.
- **When you’re on your phone, what are you usually doing?**
- Likes being on his phone, uses iMessage to talk to friends and family, likes using Tik Tok, uses Facebook and Instagram to post about his life, likes playing games on his phone
- **When you say that you post about your life on Facebook and Instagram, can you elaborate?**
- Posts life updates on Facebook and Instagram, posts pictures with his wife and baby and when he and his boys go on a fishing trip, sometimes posts with his boys at work. One time was working at a local high school and doing renovations. Saw dead animals and saw funny things. Posts these funny things sometimes and sometimes it’s selfies with his boys at work. Life updates are usually on Facebook, because of relatives are on Facebook and they interact a lot with Facebook. Instagram isn’t used much and just has an account and posts his wife sometimes and she likes it sometimes. Watches Instagram reels. Sometimes uses Instagram to scroll through Instagram and likes knowing what his friends are doing. Also uses it to keep up with the news.
- **Do you or your friends post about political or controversial topics on social media? If so, do you mind sharing what kind of topics? If not, why do you choose not to?**
- “We post when we feel like it’s important like the election is coming up, so this is a good time to be putting our voice out there”
- **Is it usually you posting or your friends posting these controversial/political posts? How does this make you feel?**
- Himself and his friends all post and a lot of the times he reposts posts that his friends post and vice versa. He thinks this is very normal because he sees people around him do this all the time. He often sees repeated posts from people he knows are friends.
- **Have people messaged about the posts you share online? If so, what kinds of messages? If not, why do you think people don't?**
- He says no because him and his friends have similar beliefs, so there are no discussions going on in social media. He thinks there's no point in messaging, because he rarely sees posts from opinions differing from him because "Why would I follow those people?". 
- **Do you have discussions in real life about controversial/political topics? Can you give me an example of a discussion you’ve had in the past?**
- In real life, talks with his friends about how stupid politics is and it’s usually not a discussion because they have similar beliefs. They usually talk about how the government is so slow and how they only focus on sensaltionlized topics and how the government is limiting how they can live their lives often times. He doesn’t think it should be controversial but believes that there is a right to bear arms and it’s written in the Constitution, but his friends and family also believe in this so there are no debates
- **What are your thoughts on the opinions of the other side of the gun rights issue?**
- He says he has heard them and the only argument they have is the mass shooting argument and believes that there are a lot of other use cases for guns like hunting with his brother and is having fun
- **You said that “the only argument they have is…”. Is this really the only argument you’ve heard and where did you hear this?**
- He heard this from multiple Instagram posts and a lot of the time sees it from celebrities posting about how they are praying for school shooting victims and then also posting about wanting more gun regulations alongside them.
- **Have you heard any other arguments than school shottings or even played the devil’s advocate yourself? Do you think this is important to do?**
- No, he hasn’t and has thought about the other side, but “I’ve thought about the other side, but that’s the only argument I can think of. I’ve never heard them say anything else. They have nothing else to use against us”. He doesn't really see the point in doing this because he just wants to focus on himself and doesn't understand why people care so much about other people.
- **Going back to reposting things on social media, can you tell me about any posts that you have reposted in the past?**
- He remembers a couple years ago, he reposted a Blue Lives Matter post. He says it was something about how police have killed so and so many people, but the police were mostly killing criminals. More police were killed compared to the number of innocent people they killed.
- **Did you fact check this statistic before you reposted this? Why?**
- No, he guessed not. He said that so many people he knew were reposting it, so he assumed it was true. He thinks that it’s not his responsibility to fact check. He thinks that because so many people are reposting this post, it’s not his job to fact check and fix it.
- **You said you get your news from Instagram. Do you get news from any other places?**
- Usually gets news from Instagram because it’s automatic and he can see it right away. If he has more questions about a topic, then he Googles it.
- **Can you give me an example about a time where you saw news on Instagram where you had more questions and Googled it yourself?**
- Saw the verdict of Trump trials on Instagram first and googled to see more information online. Also, when Biden dropped out, he got the news from Instagram first. Then, I searched it up.
- **When you searched these political news issues up, could you tell whether the author of the articles you read was biased? What are your thoughts on that?**
- Most of the time it was obvious, because with the Trump issue, a lot of the times the articles were painting him to be a criminal, which then he would assume that the article writer was left leaning. When he reads the biased stuff, he feels annoyed, because they’re not seeing his point of view and Trump’s point of view. The article writers only know what the left leaning part of the government wants them to know. The left leaning sides aren’t seeing Trump’s part of the story and the right leaning side’s view.
- **You just mentioned that the left leaning side isn’t seeing your point of view, but you also mentioned a little bit ago that you haven't really thought about the other side's point of view. Isn't this a little contradictory and can you elaborate more on why you feel this way?**
- The left side is calling the right side criminals for having guns and calling Trump a criminal, while the right side isn’t calling people criminals. Says that he can see how he was a little short sighted. “Maybe you’re right, I don’t know their point of view, but I don’t know what other arguments they even have for me to see”
- **What are your thoughts on the accuracy of the information that you see on Instagram?**
- Because everyone is reposting the same thing, even celebrities who probably have people to manage their social media and do fact checking, he trusts that it’s correct and nobody's saying that it’s incorrect.

## Write Up for Interviewee 2
- **What are some hobbies that you have?**
- Fencer, reading a lot (mostly fantasy books), shopping and browning clothes, exercising (lifting weights), taking walks with dogs, talking to her friends, hanging out with friends, playing games (mobile and computer) valorent, overwatch, makeup
- **When you’re on your phone, what are you usually doing?**
- Texting someone or doing some sort of tik tok or youtube or instagram, uses it for todo lists and reminders a lot, duolingo, and music.
- **Can you tell me how you use specific social medias on a daily basis?**
- She uses tik tok for entertainment and for instagram, she uses it to catch up with people and connect with someone without being pretty forward like using instagram instead of phone numbers and asking for snaps. Youtube used for informational like how to. She also uses Tik Tok to explain things to her.
- **What do you usually search up on Tik Tok? What are some examples?**
- She searched up jewlery gifts for mom, alexander hamilton, winx 2024, how to ace ap hug, church outfits, nickocado avocado now, who is Saddam Hussein and learned about who he is. Tik Tok is good for quick information and Google and Youtube is a lot slower.
- **What are your thoughts on the way Saddam Hussein is portrayed on TikTok? How do you feel about the information you found?**
- She thinks Saddam Hussein is portrayed accurately on Instagram, but also unserious. She learned about the man hole he hid in and how he is a dictator. She says that there are some pretty credible news places on Tik Tok like the New York Times. She learns a lot of things from Tik Tok. Sometimes it’s useless but sometimes it’s helpful.
- **You mentioned that Saddam Hussein is portrayed unseriously on Tik Tok. How do you feel about that?**
- She thinks that it’s funny, but also that he made a lot of criminal offenses that affected a lot of people, so it can make people angry that Tik Tokkers are making light of the Saddam Hussein issues and not taking it seriously.
- **How do you usually figure out if the information on TikTok is correct?**
- She usually doesn’t fact check unless she’s very interested. If she’s very interested, then she searches it up on Google.
- **You mentioned that you used Youtube for informational content like how-tos? What are some things you have searched up on Youtube?**
- She used it to search for the Donald Trump shooting and the monkeypox. She also used it to learn how to get an earring out of the sink drain. She knows how to be a plumber now. She found out that the sink was very disgusting and full of hair.
- **Do you or your friends post about political or controversial topics on social media? If so, do you mind sharing what kind of topics? If not, why do you choose not to?**
- She reposted $1 per repost post for Gaza. She also has a close friend that posts a lot of things about Gaza. She follows people on Instagram who post about how a girls get raped in India. She thinks that people are trying to seem nice, but are not doing a good job on truly helping and she thinks that they should put links and more helpful information instead of a block of text on an instagram post. ““Guys save gaza” and then they don’t put a link. Where do I donate?” She believes that they need to put more effort into allowing people to help like donations. She thinks raising awareness is good, but especially with the girl in India post, India is very far from the US so more needs to be done than just raising awareness.
- **How do you feel about posting activist things?**
- She only reposted the $1 repost for Gaza. She thinks she doesn’t know how much impact she has and doesn’t think that she can help that much especially because it’s social media. She hopes she’s making an impact because it had a link to donate. She thinks it’s important to not overkill it. Some people post on Instagram every day, which is bad because they post so often, so it detracts from the impact. She thinks it’s better to post every once in a while, so that people can tell that it’s actually important and it has a better impact. She also thinks that it’s good to make the post more attractive to read, because she wasn’t interested when the girl was posting, it was just a block of text. She also thinks it feels inauthentic and a popularity grab. She thinks that the posts about God and how to be a better person feels inauthentic, because if they were a good person, they wouldn’t do that in the first place.
- **You mentioned that people often post about God and how to become a better person, and that it reflects on the person posting it. What do you think their reasons might be for sharing this content? And since you mentioned it feels inauthentic sometimes, how do you think someone could genuinely spread God's message?**
- She thinks that oftentimes people share these posts to show people that they are good people, because they follow God’s words and do Bible study. She thinks it’s very similar to the people also posting every day about injustices in the world. She believes that quoting the Bible and posting about Bible study is ineffective, because it’s hard to change people’s perspectives with small posts. To change people’s perspectives, she thinks it needs to be more in depth and thinks the Youtube videos that are 10 min long talking about why they believe in God are more effective and impactful. She believes that religion is a choice, so if people want to believe in your religion, they will do research on it and search for it themselves. Just posting a shallow photo about how you’re spreading the word of God isn’t helping. It also makes people more annoyed, because it’s so often.
- **When you posted about donating to Gaza, how did you decide whether the donations would reach the right people? What was your thought process around that?**
- She thought it would reach the right people, because her friends all reposted it and a lot of people donated already. She also checked their Instagram and it seemed legit (a lot of informational posts). She thinks that it’s not a scam, because it would be sad if someone made it all up to gain money. All her friends reposted.
- **What made you decide to focus on donating rather than sharing informational posts?**
- She believes that bullet points and short information is good. She thinks Instagram and tik tok is very quick, so it’s good to keep information very short. She also thinks that our attention spans are very short. If text is long, she doesn’t read or skims it. She believes that the donation/$1 repost for Gaza is better, because she likes taking the pictures and going to the account when she reposts something. She believes that this is easier. The picture for the repost $1 for Gaza had a bloody kid, which grabbed her attention and was much more memorable, which is better than a long piece of text. Also, because people post all the time, she thinks it’s reposted so often that she loses interest.
- **What kinds of people and/or organizations do you follow on social media?**
- Instagram: tries to keep it to her close friends and celebrities like kpop idols and musicians. She also follows the Olympics and sports things. Tik Tok: she follows a lot of people. It’s all entertainment and people who are funny and make content she likes. She follows people who have parts in their Tik Toks. She thinks that people are nice if they don’t put their Tik Toks in parts.
- **In what ways, if any, do your interests align or differ from the people and/or organizations you follow?**
- “I don’t follow people who are very different from me.” She follows a lot of asians (as an asian), and people who post about games, fencing, and some informational accounts. She mostly follows people who are funny.
- **You mentioned that you follow informational accounts. What are some of the informational accounts you follow?**
- She follows a news channel guy who makes little shorts on news. She uses it to keep updated on the current events. She believes it’s important to keep up with what is going on in the world. She follows the paralympics to keep up with the athletes. She follows “The bikini bottom anchor” who is a fish that gives real world news. The news includes things that happen around the world like the election status. She also follows “Be Better Company” who explains business and what the true intent of influencers are. He talks about influencers becoming influencers and the issues of influencers. She learned about how Red Lobster got bankrupt.
- **How do you approach gaining different perspectives on political and controversial topics? Is it something you actively seek out?**
- She thinks it’s important to gain different perspectives and likes listening to different opinions, because it allows her to formulate her own opinions better. She says that her parents are more left leaning, so she automatically wanted to vote for democrats. She thinks this is a common occurrence where parents heavily influence how their children think. She also likes hearing other perspectives about religion. She believes that if she and her sisters didn't have social media, they wouldn’t believe in God. She and her sisters were Catholic when they were young, because their parents were Catholic. She believes that social media helped her and her sisters realize that they weren’t religious. She thinks social media helps people formulate their own opinion. She thinks the trends can be bad though, because the trend could be that everyone is a democrat, which is also a problem because they aren’t formulating their own opinions. She thinks social media is more good than bad. She watched videos on why people believe in God and this made her want to go to church and think more about what her religious beliefs are. She thinks it's good to listen to both sides like one is more into science and the other is very adamant that God exists. She’s an Asian girl who’s middle class and watches a black boy who is homeless on what he eats everyday. She wouldn’t understand what he goes through unless she saw his videos through social media and empathizes more. She’s in debate and a girl is in 6th grade who doesn’t have a phone. She debated that if all people must buy electric cars, that’s dangerous because gas cars are cheaper than electric cars and it’s harder for people to afford. The girl who didn’t have a phone on the other hand, argued that everyone could afford a Tesla in her neighborhood so it’s okay to change everything to electric. She didn’t have the world view of seeing that a lot of people cannot afford expensive cars. "Social media helps people realize our privileges."
- **Do you follow trends when uploading to social media platforms like Tik Tok or Instagram? If so, what kinds of trends? If not, why do you not follow trends?**
- She knows trendy dances and fashion trends. She thinks fashion trends are different, because they would happen outside of social media. She doesn’t think it would be as fast, mass consumerism though if social media didn’t exist. She thinks bows are really cute which is a trend right now and bought a hat. She bought a bunch of low rise jeans, which is trendy. She believes that trends are bad for the environment like fast fashion. She thinks that this would happen without social media though.
- **How do you feel about the trends you see online? Do you find yourself influenced by them at all?**
- She doesn’t think she gets influenced by them. She thinks that if she doesn’t like a trend, she won’t follow it. She doesn’t like Stanley cups, which are trendy, but she doesn’t have them. She thinks that a lot of girls her age “hop on that train quick” and follow the trends like crazy.
- **You mentioned that being on the left is a trend. What are your thoughts on that?**
- She thinks it’s definitely a trend to be on the left. She talks about how if someone posts something homophobic, they get slammed in the comments. Especially on Tik Tok, conservative people will get bashed like crazy. She thinks that the conservatives get it the worst. She thinks it’s herd mentality and thinks that’s what humans are like. If social media didn’t exist, herd mentality would still exist. If her friends said something, she would parrot it. “People are afraid to have their own opinion and get judged for it.” People are often friends with people who have the same values. Social media has two sides, she follows trends and she also uses it to look at all perspectives to get her own opinions. She thinks both sides exist and thinks maturity is important in how people use social media. She thinks that it’s not the point to compare if Israeli people or Palenstinians have it worse and thinks the government is the issue. She thinks people are scared to speak up, which is the larger issue.
- **There have been discussions about creating social media platforms tailored to specific political viewpoints, like a conservative-focused app. What are your thoughts on this idea?**
- She thinks the point of social media is finding new people and connecting with them. Having a conservative only platform (if it was based on race or sexuality then it would be discriminatory) could be compared to Reddit threads, but going out of the way to create an app to just confirm their values is weird. She thinks it’s weird to bash the left and have an app to just validate their views and just reply “Yes. I agree.” etc. She thinks people shouldn’t be saying harmful things and if that’s their view, they should vote based on their values in private. She thinks that having extreme opinions is bad, but that usually the extreme opinions go viral, so it's very easy to only hear the opinions from people with extreme views. She says that this annoys her a lot, because people either make fun of these opinons or she doesn't think these extreme opinons are well thought out and are used to gain popularity and virality.

## Summary for Interview 1
Interviewee 1 mainly uses social media to stay connected with friends and family but also shares posts on political topics, like information about upcoming elections. When asked whether he fact-checks the content he shares, he admitted, "so many people I know were reposting it, so I assumed it was true," showing how much he trusts information based on its popularity among those close to him. This highlights how people often equate the truthfulness of information with how widely it’s shared.

Interestingly, he mentioned only being aware of one main argument for stricter gun laws, saying, "I’ve thought about the other side, but that’s the only argument I can think of. I’ve never heard them say anything else." This reflects how social media can limit exposure to diverse viewpoints, often amplifying only the most viral and popular arguments. He also contradicted himself when claiming the left doesn’t understand the right’s views but quickly dismissed the left’s stance on gun laws. His visible passion about not feeling heard on social media emphasized how hard it can be for opinions that don’t go viral to gain attention. When this contradiction was pointed out, he conceded, "I don’t know their point of view, but I don’t know what other arguments they even have for me to see," reinforcing that he hasn’t had the opportunity to explore a wider range of perspectives from the other side.

## Summary for Interview 2
Interviewee 2 was often annoyed by people on social media who try to seem like good people by using serious issues. She mentioned skipping posts from someone who repeatedly posted about Gaza, showing how repetitive content can get ignored. Instead, she shared a post that donated $1 to an organization for every repost, including a link for donations. When asked about the difference, she passionately pointed out that many people post “Guys, save Gaza,” but don’t include a link, asking, "Where do [people] donate?" While raising awareness is important, she emphasized that actions, like donating, often make a bigger impact. She also mentioned how serious issues, like Saddam Hussein, are sometimes portrayed non-seriously for views, showing how social media's focus on entertainment can distort important topics.

In contrast to Interviewee 1, Interviewee 2 made a strong effort to seek out perspectives different from her own, showing how people vary in their desire to explore diverse viewpoints. This was clear when she, as an atheist, sought long-form content to understand why others believe in God. She also shared an exasperated story about a 6th grader in her neighborhood who didn’t realize not everyone can afford Teslas, a common sight in their area, noting that "social media helps people realize our privileges." She emphasized how, despite being used mostly for entertainment, social media can help people form their own opinions and connect with those from different backgrounds. She also touched on the "herd mentality" that social media fosters, where "people are afraid to have their own opinion and get judged for it," making it harder for people to express themselves freely.


## Design Opportunities
1. Balancing popularity of comments/opinions while not promoting extreme views.
- Extreme views often go viral on social media, which can be problematic. It can make people dismiss that side of the issue, even though those extreme views aren’t always representative. Interviewee 2 mentioned how Saddam Hussein, convicted of crimes against humanity, became a meme on TikTok, and how being liberal became a trend, even though that decision should be personal. Similarly, Interviewee 1 only heard one sensationalized argument for stricter gun laws, despite there being many more. However, the popularity of opinions remains important, as people want to understand broader perspectives.
2. How to keep people engaged with perspectives that aren't affirming their own.
- Many people aren't inclined to listen to people who's perspectives differ from their own. 
3. Verify information in a non-biased way.
4. Interacting with friends and families when discussing political and controversial topics while also displaying diverse opinions.
